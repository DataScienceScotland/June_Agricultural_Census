Code for June Agricultural Census

Script A inputs SAF and Census (Ags) datasets.

Script B1 processes SAF, including flagging potential errors and converting dataset to census format. B1 is B6-B9 (names from SAS project) combined.

B10 combines the census (Ags) data and the SAF data to make the combined dataset, as known as JAC.
